null\nnull\nI returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life.\nI had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it.  If anyone had told me a year\nago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact.\nThe weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick, I couldn't get\nenough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been standing in\nthe sun.  'Richard Hannay,' I kept telling myself, 'you have got into the wrong ditch, my friend,\nand you had better climb out.'
